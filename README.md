## Homework 8

### Overview

HW 8: Due 29 April 2020</br>
Networking:

1. On a single host, start the server in one window and two clients in their own windows.
Send alternating messages to the server. Try this on both Windows and Linux. Are there
any differences?
2. Invoke the client with the external IP address of the server.
3. Modify the server to return the message string received from the client back to the
client with the string “SERVER: “ prepended. That is, if client1 sends a string “Hello.” to
to the server, the server sends the string “SERVER: Hello.” back to the client. Modify the
client to receive this message and display it.

### Directory Structure

The directory structure used herein to manage documents and files is as follows:

At the top level, files describing the project meant for users to read: ```README.md```. The only other files that would be expected here is a ```.gitignore``` file, listing files and/or folders which Git should ignore and a ```.git``` file, containing git metadata. There is one subdirectory of this structure: ```/src```

**Responses to all homework questions are located in the ```/src``` subdirectory in the ```homework-8-Matthew-Montoya.md``` file.**
